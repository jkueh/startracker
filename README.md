startracker
===========

A small script I built to avoid refreshing the StarTrack web UI manually.

It parses the response given by the webpage provided by StarTrack for use on their tracking page, and outputs it to Ruby's terminal output.

At the moment, it's just a small tool that gets the events for a given consignment/tracking number.
