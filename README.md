startracker
===========

A small script I built to avoid refreshing the StarTrack web UI manually.

It parses the response given by the webpage provided by StarTrack for use on
their tracking page, and outputs it to Ruby's terminal output.

## Usage
`startracker.rb consignment_number`  
Where "consignment_number" is the consignment number, or tracking code of the
package being delivered.

## Notes

It is uncertain how likely the Startrack interface is to change, let alone be
used since their acquisition by AusPost.
